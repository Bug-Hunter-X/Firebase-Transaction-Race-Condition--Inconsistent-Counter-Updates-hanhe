The solution uses a more robust transactional approach that accounts for potential concurrent updates.  Instead of relying on a simple increment within the transaction, it reads the current value, adds one, and checks if the value matches the initial read to ensure atomicity. The code also includes error handling to manage potential database issues. This improved version helps resolve the race conditions that occurred in the original code.
