# Firebase Transaction Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition issue in a Firebase Realtime Database transaction.  The code attempts to atomically increment a counter and perform conditional logic based on the incremented value. However, due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations, this leads to unexpected and inconsistent results when multiple clients access the counter simultaneously.  The solution provided addresses this by employing a more robust approach to handle concurrent updates.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code illustrating the race condition.  The transaction reads the counter, attempts to increment it, and performs further actions based on this incremented value. If multiple clients run this code concurrently, the transaction may read stale data and result in incorrect updates.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected implementation. It uses a more robust strategy to ensure atomicity and consistency even under concurrent access. The solution handles potential race conditions and provides a reliable way to manage the counter.
